In javascript, operators ( any type of operators ) are just functions which returns one value! Well, not normally they are same as functions that we are using usually.
These types of functions are written in infix notation. Which literally means that function name we will sit in between two parameters that you had passed  to that function.

let me visualize you how infix notation is: parameter function_name parameters

lets say we are using arithmetic operator ( + ) or add function here what it is written

var a = 4 + 5; // here + is add function which is taking 4, 5 as an arguments.

well, it would really overwhelming if you use + as an function like we do normally i.e +(4, 5). The infix notation is quite human
readable and its easy to write in your program!
